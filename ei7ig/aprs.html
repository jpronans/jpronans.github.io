<a name="APRSIntro"></a><h3>An Introduction to APRS</h3>
<p>
I was asked to do an APRS introduction at the <a href="http://www.tapr.org/dcc">2009 TAPR DCC</a>. So I updated the 
previous slidesets and it is available <a href="http://www.ei7ig.org/files/Intro_to_APRS.pdf">here</a> ( about 2.7MB pdf).
</p>
<p>
I also wrote an article (An Introduction to APRS) for the IRTS's "Echo Ireland" newsletter in an attempt to make some of the ideas in the slides a bit clearer.  A PDF of the
article is available <a href="http://www.ei7ig.org/files/IntroToAPRS.pdf">here</a>, and a further article on some of the more advanced features is available <a href="http://www.ei7ig.org/files/AdvancedAPRS.pdf">here</a> 
</p>
<p>
Before try anything on APRS, please read <a href="http://www.febo.com/packet/layer-one/transmit.html">this</a> first. If you are having trouble either having your packets decoded or decoding someone elses packets.
</p>
<p>
Some good places to start gathering information are <a href="http://aprs.org">WB4APR's homepage at aprs.org</a>,
the <a href="http://info.aprs.net">APRS Wiki</a>, <a href="http://aj3u.com">AJ3U's tips on using the TM-D700</a>, 
and <a href="http://aprs.fi">aprs.fi</a> OH7LZB's Google map based tracking. Have a look at Stephen, WA8MLF's
page on <a href="http://wa8lmf.net/aprs/HF_APRS_Notes.htm">HF APRS</a>.

<h3>APRS Voice Alert</h3>
First, I suggest you have a read of WB4APRs <a href="http://aprs.org/VoiceAlert3.html">Voice Alert</a> page. Basically it's a method to utilise 144.800 to automatically alert
you to the fact that another mobile is in simplex range. 

The rules are simple and should be obvious to anyone who thinks about how the system works:
<ul>

<li>Program your radio with two APRS channels for easy switching. One with CTCSS 136.5 and one without.</li>
<li>APRS Voice Alert is for "ATTENDED OPERATIONS ONLY". Never leave it on unattended. </li>
<li>An unattended Voice Alert station is a NUISANCE to everyone for miles around. </li>
<li>Voice-Alert is a calling channel ONLY. QSY immediately to a normal voice channel.</li>
<li>ALWAYS say "voice alert" in any CTCSS 136.5 voice transmission to minimize confusion on receipt</li>
<li>If you turn your 144.800 speaker volume down, then turn off CTCSS or stop beaconing.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Kenwood TM-D710 users, check your user manuals on section APRS-13. There's also a section on Voice Alert. 
<p>

<p>
Note: If you don't have a radio like the Kenwood D7/D700/D710 (capable of putting Tx/Rx CTCSS code 
squelch on APRS packets), you can still utilize the Voice Alert concept. Simply add the APRS frequency 
(144.800 MHz in Europe) with 136.5t CTCSS Tx/Rx frequency to your list of scan channels and then you 
will only hear any APRS packets sent with the same CTCSS tone frequency. Naturally, in this case 
you won't be able to decode the APRS packets, but you will know that someone is within range of 
having a simplex QSO. 
</p>
<p>
Simply invite the other party to a 2m simplex channel as described in WB4APR's instructions. Remember 
to Tx with the same CTCSS code, otherwise the other party's squelch will not open. 
</p>
<p>
Hint: As WB4APR mentioned in his <a href="http://aprs.org/VoiceAlert3.html">instructions</a>, the fact 
you are transmitting APRS packets with a CTCSS tone means you are there to answer Voice Alerts. 
If you want to transmit APRS packets when away from the rig then do so, but without the CTCSS tone. 
An easy way to do this is to utilize two memory channels and switch between them as necessary:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Memory A) APRS 144.800 MHz with CTCSS 136.5 Hz (Rx & Tx).</li>
<li>Memory B) APRS 144.800 MHz without CTCSS. </li>
</ul>
<p>
At a recent AREN event I used it to call Francis, <a href="http://aprs.fi?call=EI5GOB-9">EI5GOB</a>. I was out of 
range of the <a href="http://http://www.searg.com/repeaters.php">SIRN repeater system</a>, I heard a Voice Alert packet, looked at the display, spotted it was Francis, EI5GOB
and quickly passed a message to him, we also agreed a simplex channel to operate on until we both got back in range of the <a href="http://http://www.searg.com/repeaters.php">repeater system</a>.
</p>

<h3>APRS In Ireland</h3> <p ie="aprs"></p>
We still have a 'fledgeling' APRS infrastructure here in Ireland, mostly concentrated in the South, South East and East of the country, with some activity in Dublin (EI7BFB Digi and I-Gate), Galway, Limerick, Cork and Tipperary.

<p>
At the moment the main part of the infrastructure is maintained by the 
<a href="http://www.searg.com">South Eastern Amateur Radio Group</a> and it consists of the nodes:
<ul>
<li>EI2WCP   - in Carraigpherish, Waterford City</li>
<li>EI2FHP   - in Faha, Dungarvan</li>
<li>EI2MLP   - on Mount Leinster</li>
<li>EI2TTP   - in Templetown, County Wexford</li>
<li>EI2GCP-2 - in Galway</li>
<li>EI9EYB-2 - in Fedamore, Co. Limerick</li>
<li>EI5CRC   - Co. Cork</li>
<li>EI7DKB-1 - Cork Harbour</li>
</ul>

Also, there are I-Gates operational at EI4GTB, EI3RCW (Waterford Institute of Technology), and sometimes my own home station.

EI8JA (SEARG's equipment manager) and I encourage the use of the following UI-PATHS in Ireland:
<ul>
<li> WIDE1-1, WIDE2-2 for Mobile Trackers</li>
<li> WIDE2-2 for Base/Fixed Stations (APRS,WIDE2-2 for UI-View)</li>
</ul>

At the moment, that is enough to reach an I-gate from pretty much anywhere in the network, which consists
of a mixture of TNC's running  <a href="http://www.ir3ip.net/iw3fqg/uidigi-e.htm">UI-DIGI</a> and 
<a href="https://www.argentdata.com/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=22&products_id=73">Argent Data Systems Tracker2</a> 
(both the T2-135 and OT2 versions)



<h3>APRS Internet Servers</h3>
<p>
The APRS-IS is an Internet-based backbone network which interconnects APRS radio networks. The core network 
consists of three (two now?) first-tier servers and numerous second-tier servers, providing a unified 
worldwide APRS stream to connected clients. </p>
<p>
Purely for practical reasons (aggregation), not political ones, I maintain a <a href="http://www.aprs2.net">Tier 2</a> server 
<a href="http://ireland.aprs2.net:14501">ireland.aprs2.net</a>, which allows Irish APRS Internet Clients 
a common aggregation point. 
<p>
The easiest way to gain access would be to configure your APRS client to connect to 
<code>ireland.aprs2.net</code> with the port set to <code>14579</code>
</p>

<p>
Xastir now supports downloading <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</a> tiles on the fly, so the rest of this section may no longer be relevant.
</a>

<p>
<a href="http://ireland.aprs2.net/xastir/IrelandMaps/Ireland.tar.gz">Here</a> are some maps made 
available courtsey of Tim, EI8IC. I added the .inf and .geo files in order
that  <a href="http://www.xastir.org/">Xastir</a> and <a href="http://www.ui-view.org/">UI-VIEW</a> can use them.
</p>

<p>
I have also generated a (9MB) map of the entire <a href="http://ireland.aprs2.net/xastir/IrelandMaps/Ireland1600x2000.bmp">country</a>, 
with a <a href="http://ireland.aprs2.net/xastir/IrelandMaps/Ireland1600x2000.geo">geo</a> and 
<a href="http://ireland.aprs2.net/xastir/IrelandMaps/Ireland1600x2000.inf">inf</a>, and the 
<a href="http://ireland.aprs2.net/xastir/IrelandMaps/IrelandSE1600x2000.bmp">South East</a> (also 9MB) with a 
<a href="http://ireland.aprs2.net/xastir/IrelandMaps/IrelandSE1600x2000.geo">geo</a> and 
<a href="http://ireland.aprs2.net/xastir/IrelandMaps/IrelandSE1600x2000.inf">inf</a> files.

<h2>OpenStreetMap</h2>
<a href="http://www.ei7ig.org/xastir/dbfawk/">Here</a> are some .dbfawk files, for 
<a href="http://www.xastir.org/">Xastir</a>. They are a work-in-progress. A company in Germany called 
<a href="http://www.geofabrik.de/">GEOFABRIK</a> have converted <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</a> to shapefile format and makes them 
available <a href="http://download.geofabrik.de/osm/">here</a>
(thanks to Carl, VK1KCM for the assistance and also the heads up).

<h3>APRS Hardware</h3>

I really like the <a href="https://www.argentdata.com/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=22&products_id=73">Tracker2</a>, as it is tidy, (the prototypes were relatively easy to construct) and is very flexible being usable as 
a tracker, digipeater and <a href="http://www.ka9q.net/papers/kiss.html">KISS</a> tnc similtaneously. <A href="http://www.aren.ie">AREN</a> has used APRS as a tactical communications tool on several events both in the hills and on the roads (<a href="http://http://www.theseankellytour.com/">Sean Kelly Tour</a>


Mobile, I use a <a href="http://www.kenwood.eu/products/comm/radio_amateur/fm_mobile/TM-D710E/">Kenwood TM-D710E</a>
(what a great radio!) along with my venerable <a href="http://www8.garmin.com/products/gps5/spec.html">Garmin GPS V</a>
